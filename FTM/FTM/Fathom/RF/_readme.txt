The 'RF' folder contains functions that are part of the 'Fathom Toolbox for Matlab'. These functions provide support for using Random Forests to create classifiers or perform regression analysis. Examples and tutorials related to these functions can be found in the 'Fathom/RF/examples' folder.

In order to use these functions you must add the 'RF' folder to Matlab's path: Set Path... > Add Folder...
